# javascript-utils

These are a list of javascript utils/snippets for the purpose of learning the internals of how some of the methods of javascript are written in libraries.

## Object/Array Compare(compare.js)
Utils to compare to two javascript objects/arrays. 
### TODO:
Should extend this for deep compare too.

## Clone(clone.js)
Snippet to clone a javascript Object for learning purposes only. This is based on Rick Waldron's implementation.
